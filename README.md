Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

nltk

scikit-learn

You can install them via pip: pip install nltk scikit-learn

This project uses NLTK's tokenizer and stopwords, which require downloading some models/data the first time you run the code.

Note: These downloads may take a while the first time you run them.
