Title: Network Topologies

Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of nodes (devices) and connections (links) in a computer network. It defines how devices are interconnected and how data flows between them. The choice of topology impacts network performance, reliability, scalability, and cost.

Examples of Common Network Topologies:

Bus Topology:

All devices are connected to a single central cable, called the bus. Data travels in both directions along this cable.
Simple and inexpensive for small networks, but a single break in the bus cable can disrupt the entire network.
Star Topology:

All devices are connected to a central hub, switch, or router. Each device has a dedicated connection to the central device.
Highly reliable as a failure in one connection doesn't affect others. Easy to install and manage, but the central device is a single point of failure.
Ring Topology:

Devices are connected in a circular fashion, forming a closed loop. Data travels in one direction around the ring, passing through each device until it reaches its destination.
Can be efficient for small networks with consistent data flow, but a single broken link can disable the entire ring, and adding/removing devices is disruptive.
Mesh Topology:

Every device is connected directly to every other device in the network. This creates multiple paths for data.
Extremely reliable and robust due to redundant paths, making it ideal for mission-critical applications. However, it's very expensive and complex to implement due to the large number of connections required.
Hybrid Topology:

A combination of two or more different basic topologies. For example, a star-bus topology where several star networks are connected to a central bus.
Offers flexibility and can be designed to meet specific network requirements, combining the advantages of different basic topologies while mitigating their disadvantages.
