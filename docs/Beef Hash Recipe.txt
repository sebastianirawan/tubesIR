Beef Hash Recipe

My Go-To Comfort Food: The Ultimate Beef Hash Recipe!
Okay, seriously, if there's one dish that screams "cozy weekend morning" or "perfect use for leftovers," it's beef hash. Forget fancy brunch spots for a sec, because this is the real deal: hearty, savory, incredibly satisfying, and surprisingly easy to whip up. It's the kind of meal that sticks to your ribs and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. This hash is a true comfort food champion!

I first got into making proper beef hash when I had some leftover roast beef that I just couldn't bear to throw out. And honestly, it transformed that humble leftover into something absolutely magical. This isn't just a side dish; it's a full-on meal, especially when a perfectly fried egg crowns this glorious hash. You're going to love this hash recipe!

The Best Damn Beef Hash You'll Ever Make (Probably!)
This hash recipe is super flexible, so feel free to adjust to your taste!

What You'll Need:

1 tbsp olive oil (or butter, if you're feeling decadent)
1 medium onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced (optional, but highly recommended for this hash!)
3-4 medium potatoes, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch cubes (Russets or Yukon Golds work great for a good hash texture)
1 bell pepper, any color, diced (adds sweetness and color to your hash)
2 cups cooked beef, diced or shredded (leftover roast beef, corned beef, or even ground beef works – just make sure it's cooked!)
1/2 tsp smoked paprika (secret ingredient for that extra depth in your hash!)
1/4 tsp black pepper (or to taste)
Salt to taste
Fresh parsley or chives, chopped, for garnish (optional, but makes this hash pretty)
Eggs, for frying (because hash NEEDS an egg!)
Let's Get Cooking This Amazing Hash!

Prep Your Potatoes: Start by getting those potatoes diced. If you want them extra crispy for your hash, you can par-boil them for about 5-7 minutes until slightly tender, then drain and let them steam dry. This isn't strictly necessary, but it helps.
Sizzle & Soften: Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet (cast iron works beautifully here!) over medium-high heat. Add the diced potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8-10 minutes until they start to get golden and tender. Don't crowd the pan, you want them to brown, not steam! This is the foundation of your hash.
Onions & Peppers Join the Party: Push the potatoes to one side of the pan. Add the diced onion and bell pepper to the other side. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and translucent, and the peppers are tender-crisp. If you're using minced garlic, add it in the last minute of cooking with the onions and peppers to infuse the hash with flavor.
Beef It Up! Now, add your cooked, diced beef to the pan. Sprinkle in the smoked paprika, black pepper, and a good pinch of salt. Stir everything together really well, making sure the beef is heated through and all those delicious flavors meld into a perfect hash.
Get Crispy! Flatten the hash mixture slightly with your spatula and let it cook undisturbed for a few minutes. This is where you get those irresistible crispy bits on the bottom of your hash. Don't stir too often!
Taste & Season: Give your hash a taste. Does it need more salt? A little more pepper? Adjust to your liking.
Egg-cellent Topping: While your hash is getting its final crisp, fry up some eggs just how you like them – sunny-side up, over easy, scrambled, whatever your heart desires!
Serve it Up: Spoon the hot, crispy hash onto plates. Top each serving with a glorious fried egg, sprinkle with fresh parsley or chives if you have them, and dig in! This hash is ready!
My Pro-Tips & Variations for Your Hash:

Spice it Up: A pinch of red pepper flakes or a dash of hot sauce stirred into the hash can add a nice kick.
Cheese Please: A handful of shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese stirred into the hash during the last few minutes of cooking, or sprinkled over the top, is never a bad idea.
Veggies Galore: Feel free to toss in other veggies like diced carrots, corn, or even some leftover cooked greens. Just make sure harder veggies are cooked through before adding them to your hash.
Meat Options: Don't have roast beef? Cooked bacon, sausage, or even shredded chicken can work in a pinch for a different kind of hash!
Breakfast for Dinner: This isn't just for mornings! Beef hash makes an amazing, easy dinner any night of the week.
So, there you have it! My absolute favorite way to make a comforting, flavour-packed beef hash. Give this hash a try this weekend, and let me know how it turns out. You won't regret this hash!
