Title: Types of Clouds

Types of Clouds: A Sky Watcher's Guide
Clouds, those beautiful, ever-changing formations in the sky, are essentially visible masses of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Their appearance, altitude, and composition are used to classify them into various types, each indicating different weather conditions.

Here are the main categories and common types of clouds:

High Clouds (Above 6,000 meters / 20,000 feet): These clouds are composed primarily of ice crystals due to the cold temperatures at their altitude.

Cirrus (Ci): Thin, wispy, feathery clouds. They indicate fair weather but can sometimes be a sign of approaching storms if they thicken.
Cirrocumulus (Cc): Small, rounded puffs that often appear in rows, sometimes called a "mackerel sky." They suggest fair but cold weather.
Cirrostratus (Cs): Transparent, whitish clouds that often cover the entire sky and can produce halos around the sun or moon. They indicate the presence of moisture and often precede rain or snow.
Middle Clouds (2,000 - 6,000 meters / 6,500 - 20,000 feet): These clouds are made of both water droplets and ice crystals.

Altocumulus (Ac): Gray or whitish patches, often with darker shading, appearing in rounded masses or rolls. They can signal fair weather or developing thunderstorms later in the day.
Altostratus (As): Gray or bluish-gray sheets or layers of clouds that often cover the entire sky. They usually indicate widespread precipitation (rain or snow) on the way.
Low Clouds (Below 2,000 meters / 6,500 feet): These clouds are composed mostly of water droplets.

Stratus (St): Uniform, gray cloud layers that often cover the entire sky, resembling fog but not touching the ground. They can produce light mist or drizzle.
Stratocumulus (Sc): Large, rounded masses or rolls, typically in groups, lines, or waves, with clear sky often visible between the cloud masses. They usually indicate fair weather.
Nimbostratus (Ns): Dark gray, shapeless cloud layers that produce continuous rain, snow, or sleet. They are thick enough to block out the sun.
Clouds with Vertical Development (Extend through multiple altitudes): These clouds can span from low to high altitudes.

Cumulus (Cu): Fluffy, white, cotton-like clouds with flat bases and distinct outlines. "Fair weather" cumulus clouds indicate pleasant weather, but larger ones can develop into thunderstorms.
Cumulonimbus (Cb): Massive, towering clouds with dark bases, often extending through all three levels, sometimes with an anvil-shaped top. These are thunderstorm clouds, bringing heavy rain, lightning, thunder, and sometimes hail or tornadoes.
