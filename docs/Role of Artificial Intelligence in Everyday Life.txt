Title: Role of Artificial Intelligence in Everyday Life

One of the most notable impacts of AI lies in its commercial applications, revolutionizing industries and
business operations across the globe. From predictive analytics driving personalized recommendations in ecommerce to autonomous vehicles navigating city streets, AI-powered solutions have become ubiquitous in
our daily lives. In the realm of healthcare, AI aids in diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized treatment
plans, enhancing patient outcomes and streamlining processes. Similarly, in finance, AI algorithms analyse
vast volumes of data to detect fraudulent transactions and optimize investment strategies, improving efficiency
and mitigating risks.
Moreover, AI serves as a crucial support system, augmenting human capabilities and enhancing productivity
in various domains. Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant provide personalized assistance
and streamline tasks, from scheduling appointments to managing smart home devices. In the realm of
customer service, AI-powered chatbots offer instant support and information, reducing response times and
enhancing user satisfaction. Additionally, AI-driven decision support systems analyse complex datasets to
provide insights and recommendations, empowering businesses and policymakers to make informed
decisions.
As AI continues to evolve, meta-learning emerges as a promising frontier, enabling machines to learn and
adapt across multiple tasks and domains. Meta-learning algorithms optimize learning strategies, transfer
knowledge between tasks, and generalize insights from limited data, paving the way for more efficient and
flexible AI systems. Moreover, the integration of AI with the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT)
opens new avenues for data-driven decision-making and automation, revolutionizing manufacturing, supply
chain management, and smart infrastructure.
Furthermore, the advent of big data and management information systems (MIS) analytics amplifies AI's
impact on business operations, enabling organizations to derive actionable insights from vast volumes of
structured and unstructured data. AI-powered analytics drive informed decision-making, enhance operational
efficiency, and unlock new opportunities for innovation and growth in the digital economy.
The rapid advancements in AI technology have led to unprecedented opportunities for innovation and progress
across diverse sectors. However, with these opportunities come significant challenges and considerations that
must be addressed to ensure the responsible and ethical deployment of AI in everyday life.
One of the key challenges is the potential impact of AI on employment dynamics and the workforce. As AI
systems automate routine tasks and augment human capabilities, there is a growing concern about job
displacement and the need for upskilling and reskilling initiatives to adapt to the evolving labour market.
Moreover, ethical considerations such as bias, fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI algorithms and
decision-making processes are paramount to safeguarding against unintended consequences and
discriminatory practices.
Furthermore, the pervasiveness of AI in everyday life raises concerns about data privacy, security, and
surveillance. As AI systems rely on vast amounts of personal data to train and improve their performance,
there is a pressing need for robust data protection regulations, encryption techniques, and transparency
mechanisms to ensure user privacy and prevent misuse of sensitive information. Additionally, the potential
for AI-enabled surveillance systems to infringe upon civil liberties and human rights underscores the
importance of establishing clear guidelines and oversight mechanisms to safeguard against abuse.
Another critical aspect is the need for inclusive and accessible AI technologies that cater to diverse populations
and address potential biases and disparities. From designing inclusive user interfaces to ensuring equitable
access to AI-powered services and opportunities, efforts must be made to bridge the digital divide and promote
digital literacy and inclusion among marginalized communities. Moreover, fostering diversity and
representation in AI research and development teams is essential to mitigating bias and ensuring the
development of fair and inclusive AI systems.
In light of these considerations, this dissertation aims to explore the multifaceted dimensions of AI integration
in everyday life, from its historical roots and technological underpinnings to its current applications, societal
implications, and future trends. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, case studies,
and comparative analyses, this study seeks to provide valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges
associated with AI deployment across different cultural, socio-economic, and geographical contexts.
Through an interdisciplinary approach that encompasses perspectives from computer science, social sciences,
ethics, law, and policy, this dissertation aims to develop guidelines and recommendations for the responsible
design, deployment, and regulation of AI technologies in everyday contexts. By fostering dialogue,
collaboration, and knowledge-sharing among stakeholders, including policymakers, industry leaders,
academics, and civil society organizations, this research endeavours to contribute to the development of a
human-centric and ethically-driven approach to AI integration that maximizes its benefits while minimizing
potential risks and harms.
As AI continues to permeate every facet of our lives, it is imperative to approach its integration with caution,
foresight, and ethical consideration. By leveraging its transformative potential responsibly and inclusively, we
can harness the power of AI to create a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous future for all.
Through a multidisciplinary approach that draws upon insights from computer science, social sciences, ethics,
law, and policy, this dissertation seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI governance and ethics,
fostering dialogue, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing among stakeholders. By promoting a human-centric and ethically-driven approach to AI integration, this research aspires to pave the way for a future where AI
serves as a force for positive change, empowering individuals, communities, and societies to thrive in the
digital age.
In conclusion, the integration of AI into everyday life heralds a new era of possibilities and challenges, shaping
the way we live, work, and interact with the world. As we embark on this transformative journey, it is
imperative to navigate the ethical, societal, and economic implications of AI deployment responsibly. By
fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, promoting ethical AI design and regulation, and prioritizing
education and awareness, we can harness the full potential of AI to create a more equitable, sustainable, and
inclusive future for all.
